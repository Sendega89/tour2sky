                Join a pilot on a unique flight and share the cost with them, a nice way to discover the city
                skyline aboard a private plane. Your pilot will happily share their passion for flying and take
                you on a memorable trip around London's area, providing stunning views of the capital's suburbs.
                Please note this aircraft is not allowed to fly over London and the flight schedule is subject
                to changes depending on the pilot’s availability. Wingly is the leading Flight Sharing platform
                in Europe. This is not a commercial flight but a private flight operated under the European cost
                sharing rule (EASA). We provide an insurance by Allianz on each flight. Be aware that
                cost-shared flights don’t have the same safety rules as commercial air transport flights. The
                risks involved can be higher, as private pilots are not subject to the same level of continuous
                checks and strict oversight rules from the authority. They still apply safety checks for every
                flight and are responsible for passengers safety.
